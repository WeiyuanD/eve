Endovascular Environment: Modular Toolbox to quickly prototype new Endovascular Environments

This Repo allows to create modular endovascular environments with the following components:

* Vesseltree
* Device
* Simulation
* Start position of episode (within bounds)
* Target selection
* Pathfinder
* Observation
* Reward
* Terminal criterion
* Truncation criterion
* Imaging (Optional)
* Interim Targets (Optional)
* Visualization (Optional)
